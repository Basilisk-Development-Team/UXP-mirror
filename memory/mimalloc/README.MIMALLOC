Commit: b69f9cb39f22b95971a4b9196a9c265a7b474718
Release: 2.2.7

Notes:
- Copied include/, src/, LICENSE, and readme.md from upstream.
- Removed upstream prebuilt binaries under bin/.
- Added mozbuild integration via moz.build for static.c and exports.
- Adjusted Unix getenv handling to avoid raw environ traversal during process init,
  using getenv only after preloading to prevent loader-time crashes.
- On GNU platforms, prefer weak `_environ` over `environ` to handle glibc DSO visibility.
- Darwin build uses MI_OSX_ZONE without MI_OSX_INTERPOSE to avoid duplicate
  interpose definitions.
- Windows exports mi_* symbols from mozglue to satisfy mozalloc inlines.
